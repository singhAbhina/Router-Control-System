# Router-Control-System


## ðŸ“„ Overview

This project simulates a **Router Network Control System** that allows users to manage and analyze a network of routers. It provides functionalities such as viewing network topology, computing shortest paths, finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), detecting critical connections, adding/removing routers, and displaying routing tables.

The program is built using **C++** and demonstrates the application of graph algorithms such as **Dijkstra's algorithm**, **Prim's algorithm**, and **bridge-finding algorithms** in the context of network routing.

All outputs are saved in `network_output.txt`.

## ðŸŸ  Features

âœ” Display the current network topology  
âœ” Compute shortest paths from a given router using **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**  
âœ” Find the Minimum Spanning Tree using **Primâ€™s algorithm**  
âœ” Detect critical connections (bridges) that impact network connectivity  
âœ” Add a new router dynamically with IP and MAC address generation  
âœ” Remove an existing router safely, updating the network structure  
âœ” Display routing tables showing next hops for each router  
âœ” User-friendly command-line control panel interface
